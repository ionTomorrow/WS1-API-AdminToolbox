The primary purpose of this project is to create a set of reuseable cmdlets to interact with the WS1 API via PowerShell. 
There are many great scripts put online, but one thing in common is they all spend a lot of unnecessary effort re-creating basic functions. 
The publicly available APIs from VMware are reasonably well-documented and contain clearly known parameters.

The goal for this is to reduce the time for a WS1 admin to write scripts for their environment.
Let's focus on getting things done and not creating 10 ways to do the same thing.


## NOTE: This effort is community-driven and is not supported by VMware. Please perform due diligence and review code and consider this before running in a production environment. These cmdlets are frequently being improved and may not function as expected. Always test your code in a non-production environment first!


These updated functions are intended to work with PowerShell Core. Please install that before you try to use the functions in these modules! https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell



## List of Modules and generalized purpose if not clear by name:

* AdminUsers.psm1 -- Work with Admin Accounts
* ConnectionConfig.psm1 -- setup of the API connection, getting credentials, etc.
* Devices.psm1 -- Work with Devices
* InputFunctions.psm1 -- Functions for importing .csv files and helping setup scripting environment
* OrgGroups.psm1 -- Work with OGs
* SmartGroups.psm1 -- Work with SGs
* TAGs.psm1 -- Work with TAGs
* Users.psm1 -- Work with standard User accounts

## USAGE
### 1. Import cmdlets
To use these cmdlets, they must be imported as modules. You can use the ./ws1_sample_start.ps1 script to import them. The modules reference each other to reduce code reuse, so you should import all of the modules and not skip any.

### 2. run select-ws1config
Once the modules have been imported, assign a variable to the `select-ws1Config` cmdlet to generate REST API Headers.
    `$headers = select-ws1Config`
    
    The select-ws1Config will walk you through how you want to connect to the API.


### 3. use cmdlets like any other PS cmdlet including tab completion.

When you need to use the **-header** parameter, you will use the variable assigned in USAGE setp 2. (i.e. `$headers = select-ws1Config`)
    
Functions in each script can have their help contents retrieved like other cmdlets.
